This is a sample `wp-config.php` file for WordPress configuration. It includes sections for MySQL settings (database name, user, password, and host), authentication unique keys and salts meant to be replaced with secure values, the database table prefix, and a debugging mode toggle. Additionally, it sets the absolute path to the WordPress directory and includes the `wp-settings.php` file.
