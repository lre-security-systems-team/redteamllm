assistant:
The command installed new packages: `libkmod2`, `libpci3`, `pci.ids`, and `pciutils`. `usbutils` was already the newest version and was set to be manually installed. The installation fetched 532 kB of archives, requiring an additional 2084 kB of disk space. During the process, there was a message indicating the inability to use the dialog-based frontend for `debconf`, which fell back to the Readline frontend. After unpacking the downloaded packages, they were successfully set up, and the system processed triggers for `libc-bin`.
