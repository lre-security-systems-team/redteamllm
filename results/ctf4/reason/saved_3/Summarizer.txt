assistant:
The `apt-get install sqlmap -y` command executed successfully. It installed the new packages: libmagic-mgc, libmagic1t64, python3-magic, and sqlmap. A total of 7356 kB of archives were fetched, using 20.0 MB of additional disk space. During installation, the debconf frontend fell back to "Readline" due to the absence of a dialog-like program. The setup of each package was completed without errors.
