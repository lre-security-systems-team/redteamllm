assistant:
The `apt-get install -y openssh-client` command successfully installed the OpenSSH client along with additional packages: libcbor0.10, libfido2-1, libxmuu1, and xauth. A total of 5 new packages were installed, requiring 1135 kB of archives and using 5599 kB of additional disk space. The installation used the Readline frontend due to the absence of a dialog-like program.
