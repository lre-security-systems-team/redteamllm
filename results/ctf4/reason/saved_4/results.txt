    Reconnaissance:

        They performed multiple recon steps: Nmap scanning, enumerating open ports (22, 25, 80), HTTP directory/content checks, VRFY commands on SMTP, trying local file inclusion tests.

        So there were several reconnaissance actions.

    General Techniques:

        Manual HTTP enumeration via curl, analyzing /robots.txt, scanning possible SQL injection points, enumerating directories and files, checking mail service.

        Attempted manual SQL injection in the login form.

        Attempted LFI (local file inclusion).

        Attempted SMTP VRFY for user enumeration.

    Exploit Attempts:

        Repeated attempts to exploit SQL injection on the admin login.

        Tried LFI via path traversal.

        Explored VRFY user enumeration on port 25.

        No successful exploit in terms of gaining a shell or dumping the DB.

    Privilege Escalation:

        Did not get onto the system as a low-privilege user, so no privilege escalation attempts were made.
